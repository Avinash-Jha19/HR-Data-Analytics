## Employee Presence Report Dashboard for AtliQ Hardware (Power BI)

**Project Objective:**

- Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard _[Employee Presence Report](https://github.com/Avinash-Jha19/HR-Data-Analytics/blob/main/HR_Analytics.pdf)_ for AtliQ Hardware's HR department to analyze employee presence data (attendance, WFH, SL).
- Provide actionable insights to optimize team-building activities, hybrid work model, and address potential health concerns.

**Situation:**

- AtliQ's HR team relied on manual data analysis from Excel sheets, leading to inefficiencies and limited insights.
- They needed a solution to:
    - Understand employee work preferences (WFH vs. WFO).
    - Identify WFO frequency patterns across the week.
    - Track SL percentages and trends.
    - Analyze attendance, WFH, and SL trends over months.
    - Gain insights into individual employee presence patterns.

**Action:**

- Cleaned and transformed employee presence data from Excel sheets into a cohesive Power BI model.
- Created interactive visualizations for:
    - Attendance, WFH, and SL trends over time (days, weeks, months).
    - WFO frequency distribution across the week.
    - Individual employee presence breakdowns.
- Utilized DAX calculations to derive key metrics and insights.
- Collaborated with HR to ensure the dashboard met their needs and usability preferences.

**Result:**

- Delivered a user-friendly Power BI dashboard with actionable insights on employee presence patterns.
- Enabled HR to:
    - Plan team-building activities and lunches when most employees are present (WFH/WFO preference).
    - Implement a data-driven hybrid work model (e.g., 2 days WFH, 3 days WFO).
    - Optimize space utilization and potentially save costs.
    - Take targeted sanitization measures and arrange doctor checkups based on SL trends.
- Improved HR efficiency by streamlining data analysis and saving 3-4 hours daily.
